    "    \"Pinot Noir\": \"The quintessential Willamette Valley grape. It presents a silky, elegant texture balanced by vibrant acidity. Expect a complex aromatic profile of wild strawberry, Rainier cherry, and damp forest floor, with a subtle spice of white pepper. The volcanic Jory soils often impart a distinct stony minerality, while marine sedimentary soils can add a savory, umami-like depth.\",\n",
    "    \"Pinot Gris\": \"A textural and aromatic delight, often crafted in an Alsatian-inspired style. It reveals layers of ripe pear, quince, and beeswax, with a spicy hint of ginger. A brief period of skin contact lends a beautiful copper hue and a pleasant bitter note of orange peel, adding to its complexity.\",\n",
    "    \"Chardonnay\": \"A grape of two distinct personalities in the Valley. The 'Lean' style, often from the Eola-Amity Hills, offers crisp green apple, wet flint, and lemon pith with laser-like acidity. The 'Rich' style, typical of the Dundee Hills, delivers notes of baked apple, brioche, and toasted hazelnut with a rounder, creamier mid-palate.\",\n",
    "    \"Riesling\": \"A noble grape with remarkable aging potential. In its youth, it bursts with notes of peach skin and a hint of kerosene, which evolves into complex honeycomb and petrol notes over time. Dry expressions possess a searing acidity, while late-harvest styles are luscious with apricot nectar.\",\n",
    "    \"Gamay\": \"Vibrant and juicy, this grape is all about immediate pleasure. It explodes with flavors of cranberry, pomegranate, and rose hip, grounded by a subtle black tea leaf earthiness. Carbonic maceration often lends a characteristic bubblegum lift and softens the tannins, making it irresistibly quaffable.\",\n",
    "    \"Syrah\": \"A testament to cool-climate intensity. This grape offers a brooding bouquet of blackberry compote, violets, and savory notes of smoked meat and black olive. The persistent winds of the Van Duzer Corridor impart a signature peppery grip and firm, chewy tannins.\",\n",
    "    \"Pinot Blanc\": \"A varietal of quiet power and finesse. It whispers notes of lemon curd, raw almond, and a distinct saline minerality reminiscent of sea spray. It is often blended with Chardonnay to enhance textural weight and complexity.\",\n",
    "    \"Dolcetto\": \"An Oregonian take on a Piedmont classic. It features a core of bitter cherry, interwoven with notes of tar, licorice, and blueberry skin. Compared to its Italian counterpart, the Willamette Valley version often showcases brighter acidity and a unique iron oxide grit from the local soils.\",\n",
    "    \"Tempranillo\": \"Feral, savory, and complex. This Spanish grape reveals a rustic profile of sour plum, tobacco leaf, and worn leather. It demands sun-drenched, south-facing slopes to achieve full ripeness and express its sun-baked character.\",\n",
    "    \"Lagrein\": \"Inky, brooding, and powerful. This Northern Italian varietal is characterized by intense notes of black raspberry, dark cocoa powder, and a ferrous hint of beef blood. The tannins are famously robust, often described as 'chewing on grape seeds.'\",\n",
    "    \"Carmine\": \"A fascinating hybrid with a bold personality. It combines the structure of Cabernet Sauvignon with the rustic charm of Carignan, resulting in a wine with notes of cranberry sauce, bell pepper, and dark chocolate.\",\n",
    "    \"Grüner Veltliner\": \"Austria's star grape, finding a happy home in Oregon. It is defined by its signature white pepper and radish-like crunch, complemented by flavors of green pear, lentil, and lime zest. The local Jory soils contribute a smoky, flinty nuance.\",\n",
    "    \"Müller-Thurgau\": \"A charming, off-dry white perfect for casual sipping. It delights with aromatic notes of lychee, elderflower, and bruised apple. Its naturally low alcohol content makes it a light and refreshing picnic wine.\",\n",
    "    \"Albariño\": \"A burst of seaside freshness. This Spanish varietal is defined by its saline minerality, evoking sea spray on a coastal breeze. Flavors of white peach and lemongrass are carried on a wave of crisp acidity, making it exceptionally refreshing.\",\n",
    "    \"Arneis\": \"A varietal of bitter elegance from Piedmont. It offers a sophisticated bouquet of fennel pollen, chamomile, and blanched almond. The finish is characteristically bitter, reminiscent of a peach pit, which adds to its allure.\",\n",
    "    \"Pinot Meunier\": \"Primarily a sparkling wine grape, it shines with notes of red apple skin and freshly baked brioche. It contributes to a creamy, persistent mousse, creating a wine of great texture and charm.\",\n",
    "    \"Gewürztraminer\": \"An aromatic explosion in the glass. It offers an unmistakable bouquet of lychee and rosewater, with a rich, slightly oily texture that coats the palate. Willamette Valley versions are often fermented dry, showcasing the grape's full aromatic potential.\",\n",
    "    \"Pinot Noir Précoce\": \"An early-ripening clone, considered an ancestor of Pinot Noir. It delivers a wilder, more rustic expression of its descendant, with intense notes of wild strawberry and blood orange.\",\n",
    "    \"Blaufränkisch\": \"An Austrian red with a savage edge. It presents a deep profile of blueberry liqueur and graphite, supported by fierce, structured tannins that demand attention.\",\n",
    "    \"Sauvignon Blanc\": \"A nod to the restrained style of the Loire Valley. It offers crisp notes of gooseberry and freshly cut grass, with a focus on minerality and elegance rather than overt tropical fruit.\"\n",
