* State how this site gives information on all Willamette Valley Vineyards/Wineries to give a full overview of the diversity of wines in this unique region. 
* As far as points for the wineries on the map, make them the same color as the AVA they are in. Then when a user hovers over the points, a themed description card should pop up with information.
* For a website symbol, create 2 Vs, one right above the other, with the top one filled halfway inside of it with a red wavy color to look like a filled wine glass.
* For the Tasting The Terroir page, split up the sections into science fields such as geology, geography, meteorology, physics, chemistry, and biology.
* For the map, try and do a selector at the top that has multiple options. It can something like Vineyards/Wineries/Wine Bars, Soil, Microclimate, and Elevation. Then make the selector keep the selections unless clicked on again, so that all layers can be stacked.
