Willakenzie soils are particularly prominent in areas like Ribbon Ridge and portions of Yamhill-Carlton AVA, where they produce elegant Pinot Noir wines with vibrant red fruit profiles, excellent energy and brightness, notable minerality, and complex savory undertones that reflect the ancient oceanic origins of these sedimentary deposits .'

    witzel: {
      title: 'Witzel',
      soilDepthToBedrock: '12-20 inches',
      drainageClassification: 'Well Drained',
      parentMaterial: 'Loamy colluvium derived from basalt',
      awc: '0.06-0.10 in/in',
      cec: '8-15 meq/100g',
      description: 'The Witzel series represents one of the most challenging yet rewarding terroirs in the Willamette Valley, consisting of shallow, well-drained soils formed from basaltic colluvium on hillsides and ridgetops. This skeletal soil series is characterized by high rock fragment content (40-75 percent) and reaches bedrock at just 12 to 20 inches depth, creating intense drainage that forces vine roots to penetrate fractured basalt for water and nutrients. The extremely shallow, broken basalt foundation provides natural water stress that concentrates flavors and limits yields, producing wines of exceptional intensity and mineral complexity. The volcanic terroir contributes distinctive mineral notes and structural backbone to Pinot Noir, while the limited water-holding capacity creates wines with pronounced concentration and age-worthy tannin structure. For Willamette Valley viticulture, Witzel soils represent the extreme expression of volcanic terroir, demanding careful site selection and rootstock matching but rewarding vintners with wines of remarkable depth and distinctive volcanic character.'

      awc: '0.16-0.20 in/in',
      cec: '12-22 meq/100g',
      description: 'Woodburn soils formed from ancient Missoula Flood deposits that created the fertile valley floor of the Willamette Valley over 15,000 years ago. These deep, silty soils are prized for their excellent nutrient-holding capacity and consistent moisture availability throughout the growing season, supporting larger vine canopies and higher yields than hillside sites. The fine-silty texture and seasonal water table at 20-30 inches create conditions that produce Pinot Noir with softer tannins, darker fruit profiles, and earlier ripening characteristics. While wines from Woodburn soils may lack the complexity of those from volcanic or sedimentary hillside sites, they offer approachable fruit-forward profiles with good balance, making them ideal for producing consistent, commercially viable wines that showcase the accessibility of Willamette Valley Pinot Noir.'

      awc: '0.12-0.16 in/in',
      cec: '20-35 meq/100g',
      description: 'Yamhill soils are moderately deep, reddish-brown soils formed from ancient basalt flows that were part of the Columbia River Basalt Group formations. These fine-textured soils with 35-50% clay content provide moderate water retention while their shallower depth to bedrock naturally limits vine vigor and creates stress that concentrates flavors in the fruit. The basalt parent material contributes to distinctive mineral characteristics and darker fruit profiles in Willamette Valley Pinot Noir, often showing blackberry and dark cherry notes with earthy undertones. The combination of good drainage, restricted rooting depth, and high nutrient-holding capacity produces wines with firm tannin structure, concentrated flavors, and excellent aging potential that exemplify the power and complexity possible from Oregon\'s volcanic terroirs.'

              When you hover over soil areas on the map above, you'll see specific names like "Jory silty clay loam" or "Rickreall silty clay loam", these are soil series names that represent specific soil types with unique characteristics and formation histories. A soil series is a classification system that groups soils with similar characteristics, formation processes, and mineral compositions, think of it as a "family name" for soil types. So when you see names like "Jory silty loam" or "Rickreall silty loam," the first word (Jory or Rickreall) identifies the soil series, while the second part describes the texture. Each soil series has distinct properties that influence how grapevines grow, including drainage patterns, mineral content, water retention, and heat absorption, all of which directly impact the flavor profile, structure, and character of the wines produced. The Willamette Valley has a very diverse set of soil families, formed by ancient lava flows, marine sediments, and glacial deposits. These environments create distinct microclimates and growing conditions that contribute to this region's renowned terroir-driven wines. This section is meant to walk through each unique soil series found across the Willamette Valley's vineyards (not <i>every</i> soil series found in Oregon), which is designed to help you understand how the ground beneath the vines shapes the wine in your glass. The soil series types below are ordered alphabetically to reference quickly and easily after looking at one on the map above.
